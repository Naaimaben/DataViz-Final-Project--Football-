# Visualizing the World Cup and Premier League’s Data Using Tableau and ggplot2

Big Data is playing a great role in football to generate raw data about players and games that allows club managers to be aware of how their players respond and act on the field. This can’t be achieved without the use of Data visualization that translates information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets. Data Visualization makes it easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from the data.

## Project description
 
This project uses the data from both the world cup and the English Premier League to visualize the patterns and outliers from the datasets using data visualization tools such as Tableau and ggplot2.

## Data Source
FBref.com, a website devoted to tracking statistics for football teams and players from around the world. It was created by Sports Reference, the team behind popular stats websites like Baseball Reference and Basketball Reference
